## Challenge

Create a function called fizzBuzzTree that takes in the root node of a tree, traverses it, and modifies the values based on what they are divisible by.

## Approach & Efficiency

I decided to modify the tree in place and then return the root node. 
Big O is O(n) space is O(1) because I never create any variables
