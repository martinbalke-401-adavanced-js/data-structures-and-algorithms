Code Challenge 19. Implementing insertion sort.

## Whiteboard / Drawing

<!-- Photo of your whiteboard or drawing -->

## Challenge

Create a function called insertionSort which takes in an array and returns a sorted array.

## Approach & Efficiency

I went with a sorting in place methodology. Where I don't need to create any extra variables besides a temp in order to return a sorted array.

Time O(n2) Because we are iterating over the whole array and then decrementing over the whole array I believe this is the correct big O

Space 0(n)

## API

`insertionSort(arr)`-> `returns {Array} - sorted array`
