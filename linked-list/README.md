# Singly Linked List

This challenge was to build a singly linked list with the methods insert, includes, and toString.

## Challenge

The method insert needs to be able to insert a node at the begining of the linked list with the specified value. The method includes needs to be able to check each nodes data property and return true if a given value is included in the linked list or false if it is not. The method toString needs to a string representing all of the values inside of the linked list.

## Space Time

I think the Big 0 and space here are 0(n) 


## API

`insert` -> (val) `returns` -> this

Inserts a new node in to the linked list

`includes` -> (val) `returns` -> boolean

Checks the linked list against a given value

`toString` -> () `returns` -> string

Returns a string of all the data in the linked list
